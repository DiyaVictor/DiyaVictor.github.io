🌟 Diya's Digital Playground (a.k.a Portfolio Website)
Welcome to my corner of the internet where pixels meet purpose and bugs meet their doom.
This is my personal portfolio – a digital museum of my blood, sweat, and coffee-fueled code ☕💻.

What’s Inside:

🧠 Projects that may or may not have broken the space-time continuum

🛠️ Skills that make recruiters raise their eyebrows (in a good way)

🎓 Achievements that scream “I didn’t sleep for this”

📝 Resume, because adulting

📮 A contact form – slide into my inbox, professionally, of course

Built With: HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Love & Debugging
